        <h2 class="ptitle">What is Information Technology?</h2>
        <p>Information Technology (IT) is a modern concept or methodology of communication, combining Information and Communication Technology to facilitate information flow in various fields. IT has made the world closer, enabling instant messaging across the globe. It is widely used in education, industry, banks, research centers, hospitals, and more.</p>
        <p>In education, IT serves as a learning and teaching tool, making distance learning possible. In industries, IT controls the quantity and quality of products, and in hospitals, it aids in management and patient treatment. IT also enhances animation and entertainment sectors, and it is crucial in scientific research and space technology.</p>

        <h2 class="ptitle">Social Impacts of Information Technology</h2>
        <p>While IT has many positive impacts on society, it also has negative aspects. As IT use increases, so do cyber crimes. Cyber criminals can easily steal information, disclose secrets, and spread viruses, disturbing social peace and security.</p>

        <h2 class="ptitle">Information Security</h2>
        <p>In cyberspace, there is always a threat of cyber attacks leading to loss and damage of data. Information security involves protecting network infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or destruction. It includes various physical and software preventive measures to create a secure environment for computers, users, and programs.</p>
        <p>Information security aims to mitigate security threats and attacks. Security threats are possible dangers that may cause unwanted activities in a computer system, while security attacks are attempts to gain unauthorized access to destroy, expose, steal, or alter valuable data. Common threats include viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, and worms.</p>
        
        <h3>Objectives of Information Security</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Maintaining accuracy and completeness of data, preventing unauthorized tampering.</li>
            <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring information is accessible whenever required.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="ptitle">Cryptography</h2>
        <p>Cryptography, derived from the Greek word meaning “secret writing,” is the art and science of hiding information, providing security for communication. It involves encryption (converting plaintext into an unreadable format) and decryption (converting ciphertext back into readable form). Encryption uses special algorithms and keys, making messages unreadable to unauthorized users.</p>

        <h2 class="ptitle">What is Digital Divide?</h2>
        <p>The digital divide refers to the gap between computer-literate and illiterate individuals. It highlights the division between technical and non-technical people in society. Despite the increasing importance of IT, many individuals lack basic computer knowledge and understanding of related terms. This gap is growing, particularly between urban and rural populations, educated and uneducated individuals, and rich and poor communities. The digital divide has become a global issue, prompting governments to work toward bridging this gap.</p>
