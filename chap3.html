        <p><strong>Definition of Software:</strong> Software refers to a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work. It is the non-tangible component of a computer system, enabling hardware to perform specific tasks.</p>
        <p><strong>Categories of Software:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>System Software:</strong> Includes operating systems and utility programs that manage computer resources at a low level.</li>
            <li><strong>Utility Software:</strong> Performs specific tasks to help manage, maintain, or protect the computer, such as antivirus programs or disk management tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Application Software:</strong> Programs designed to perform specific tasks for the user, like word processors, spreadsheets, or media players.</li>
            <li><strong>Web-Based Software:</strong> Applications that run on web browsers, requiring internet connectivity, such as online email or cloud storage services.</li>

        <p><strong>Introduction to Operating System:</strong> An Operating System (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware.</p>
        <p><strong>Role of Operating System:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Process Management:</strong> Oversees the execution of processes, ensuring efficient CPU utilization and process scheduling.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Manages the computer's memory, allocating space to programs and ensuring optimal use of RAM.</li>
            <li><strong>File System Management:</strong> Organizes and controls access to data stored on disk drives, maintaining file hierarchies and permissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Management:</strong> Coordinates and manages input/output devices, facilitating communication between hardware and software.</li>
            <li><strong>Security and Access Control:</strong> Protects data and resources from unauthorized access, ensuring system integrity and user privacy.</li>
        </ul>
