        <h2 class="ptitle">What is Multimedia?</h2>
        <p>Multimedia consists of two words ‘Multi’ and ‘Media’, where ‘Multi’ means many and ‘Media’ means a way/medium of expressing information. Multimedia is the way of expressing information in different forms like text, audio, video, graphics, and animation. We use several forms of media for better understanding and effective communication. By using multimedia, any information can be illustrated in greater depth.</p>
        <p>Since a single form of media is inefficient for better communication and greater understanding, we integrate several components of multimedia (text, audio, video, animation, and graphics) using a multimedia computer system. Hence, the integration of different forms of media is mandatory for effective communication.</p>

        <h2 class="ptitle">Multimedia Computer System</h2>
        <p>A multimedia computer system consists of multimedia hardware and multimedia software. These components work together to integrate various multimedia elements.</p>
        <h3>Hardware:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Printer</li>
            <li>Projector</li>
            <li>Webcam</li>
            <li>Microphone</li>
            <li>Digital Camera</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Software:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Text Editor (MS Word)</li>
            <li>Presentation Tool (PowerPoint)</li>
            <li>Photo Editing Software (Photoshop)</li>
            <li>Video Editing Software (iMovie)</li>
            <li>Accounting Package (Tally)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, a video can be created by integrating audio and images.</p>

        <h2 class="ptitle">Advantages of Multimedia</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It helps to make communication much more effective.</li>
            <li>It enhances the level of understanding of any particular topic.</li>
            <li>Games, cartoons, and movies are made more effective and realistic by using multimedia.</li>
            <li>It makes the teaching and learning process much more interesting and intuitive.</li>
            <li>Virtual reality and simulation have become more realistic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="ptitle">Disadvantages of Multimedia</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Multimedia components may be expensive.</li>
            <li>Technical knowledge and IT literacy are required to operate multimedia.</li>
            <li>Technology is always changing and never constant.</li>
            <li>Multimedia devices run on electricity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="ptitle">Components of Multimedia</h2>
        <h3>Text</h3>
        <p>Text is a collection of alphanumeric values or characters. It can be a word, a single line, or a paragraph. We can create and customize text using word processors such as MS-Word and Notepad. Extensions: .docx, .txt.</p>
        
        <h3>Graphics/Images</h3>
        <p>"A picture is worth a thousand words," meaning a picture can describe things better than text. Graphics generally refer to images or pictures. The smallest element of a picture is called a pixel (Picture Element). The quality of an image is denoted by the number of pixels, known as resolution. Multimedia software such as Adobe Photoshop and Corel Draw are used for graphic design. Extensions: .jpeg, .png.</p>
        
        <h3>Audio</h3>
        <p>Audio is an important component of multimedia, giving the sensation of hearing. Audio can include human voices, instrumental notes, natural sounds, and digitally synthesized sounds. FM radio uses audio to express information. Extensions: .mp3, .wma.</p>
        
        <h3>Video</h3>
        <p>Video consists of a sequence of static images played at a high speed. Frame per second (FPS) determines the smoothness of a video. Common standards include 15-25 FPS, while 30 and 60 FPS are widely used. Extensions: .mp4, .mpeg.</p>
        
        <h3>Animation</h3>
        <p>Animation is a sequence of computer-generated images displayed in rapid succession to create visual effects. It is widely used in movies and entertainment. Animations can be 2D or 3D, with 3D being more realistic. Multimedia software such as Maya, AutoCAD, and Macromedia Flash are used for animation. Extensions: .flv, .gif.</p>

        <h2 class="ptitle">Applications of Multimedia</h2>
        <p>Multimedia is widely used in various fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Education:</strong> Used in e-learning, digital classrooms, and online tutorials.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Video conferencing, social media, and digital messaging.</li>
            <li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> Movies, animations, video games, and music streaming.</li>
            <li><strong>Medicine:</strong> Used in medical simulations, training, and telemedicine.</li>
            <li><strong>Science and Technology:</strong> Virtual labs, scientific modeling, and research simulations.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertisement:</strong> Digital marketing, commercials, and promotional content.</li>
            <li><strong>Websites/Webpages:</strong> Multimedia elements enhance web pages for better user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Research and Engineering:</strong> 3D modeling, computer-aided design (CAD), and engineering simulation.</li>
        </ul>
